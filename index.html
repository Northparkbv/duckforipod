          Update: I have bought the ipod shuffle below, and:
            <ol>
                <li>The battery is terrible</li>
                <li>When a song finishes, it skips back to the beginning</li>
                <li>The on off switch doesn't work, so I have to leave it on all the time</li>
                <li>It came with some maracas discuised as earphones</li>
            </ol>
        SO what I have found is that you shouldn't buy ripoff things from amazon.
